# HouseRenting
Webbapplikasjon project - DND / Airbnb inspired rental site.
Our project "AirDnD" is a property renting website like Airbnb. The code project is based on .NET 6.0 and the Model-View-Controller framework. On AirDnD you can book fantasy housing locations online, just like Airbnb. You can browse the listings available on the site as a guest, or you can create a user, make your own listings, and book a stay at other locations. CRUD functionality is included for Listings and Users. 

Download project, launch "myshop.sln", to be able to create, update, delete or book anything you need a user. 
Register, register an account and then do what you wish to do. 
Create new listing, check out bookings. 
Edit Listings to update or delete preview listings.
Try it out yourself! Have fun with it ^.^
